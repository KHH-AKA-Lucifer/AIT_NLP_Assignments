<h1>Rogue One</h1><p>
</p><p>Rogue One (or Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) is a 2016 American epic space opera film directed by Gareth Edwards. The screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is based on a story by John Knoll and Gary Whitta. The movie was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the first installment of the Star Wars anthology series, and an immediate prequel to Star Wars (1977). The main cast consists of Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, and Forest Whitaker. Set a week before the events of Star Wars, the plot follows a group of rebels who band together to steal plans of the Death Star, the ultimate weapon of the Galactic Empire. It details the Rebel Alliance's first effective victory against the Empire, first referenced in Star Wars' opening crawl.
Based on an idea first pitched by Knoll ten years before it entered development, the film was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Principal photography on the film began at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, in early August 2015 and wrapped in February 2016. The film then went through extensive reshoots in mid-2016. The film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino, rather than John Williams, who composed the score of all prior Skywalker Saga films up to that point. With an estimated production budget of $200-265 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.
Rogue One premiered in Los Angeles on December 10, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, story, visuals, musical score, cinematography, and the darker and more serious tone compared to previous Star Wars films, but criticism for its pacing, characters, and digital recreations of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. It grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2016 during its theatrical run. It received two Academy Award nominations for Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects. A prequel television series, titled Andor, premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on September 21, 2022, with Luna reprising his role as the title character.
</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Research scientist Galen Erso and his family hide on the planet Lah'mu when Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star, a superweapon capable of destroying planets. Galen's wife Lyra is killed in the confrontation while their five year old daughter Jyn escapes and is rescued by rebel freedom fighter Saw Gerrera.
Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message from Galen to Gerrera on the moon Jedha. Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star and Rook's defection from an informant. Jyn is freed from an Imperial labor camp on Wobani and is brought to the Rebels' secret base on Yavin IV where leader Mon Mothma convinces her to find Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the superweapon. Cassian is covertly ordered to aid Jyn but kill Galen rather than extract him.
Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed former Imperial droid K-2SO travel to Jedha, where the Empire loots kyber crystals from Jedha City to power the Death Star. Gerrera and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against them. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Îmwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus, Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who holds Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star. The schematics detailing this are in an Imperial data vault on the planet Scarif.
Onboard the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test fire which destroys Jedha City. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains there to die. Imperial governor Grand Moff Tarkin congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the Death Star project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu, where Cassian declines to kill Galen. Rebel bombers then attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in Jyn's arms, before she escapes with her group on a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by Darth Vader to answer for the attack on Jedha. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the Emperor, but Vader instead chokes him and orders him to ensure no further problems occur.
At the Rebel base, Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel fighting the Empire is now pointless. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group leads a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the vault; the group arrives on Scarif in the stolen Imperial shuttle (which Rook dubs "Rogue One") after having been granted access through the planet's shield by feigning as legitimate traffic. Jyn, Cassian, and K-2SO infiltrate the base while the other Rebels attack the Imperial garrison as a diversion.
The Alliance learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploys their fleet in support, leading to a space battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleets. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus is killed shortly afterward. Rook is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the planetary shield to allow the transmission of the schematics. Rebel Admiral Raddus uses a Rebel ship to crash two Imperial Star Destroyers into each other; the wreckage collides with and destroys the shield generator. Jyn obtains the schematics but is ambushed by Krennic, who is shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship moments before the Death Star arrives above Scarif. With another shot from the Death Star, Tarkin destroys the base citadel, killing Krennic, Cassian, Jyn, and the remaining Rebel and  Imperial ground forces.
The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to hyperspace. However, Admiral Raddus and many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's Star Destroyer. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and kills many troops trying to regain the schematics, but a smaller ship escapes with the schematics on board. Aboard the fleeing ship, Princess Leia Organa declares that the schematics will provide hope for the Rebellion as the ship enters hyperspace.
