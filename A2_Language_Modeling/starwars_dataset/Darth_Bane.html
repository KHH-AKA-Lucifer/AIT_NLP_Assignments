<h1>Darth Bane</h1><p>Darth Bane is a fictional character created by George Lucas in the Star Wars franchise. In the Star Wars universe, Darth Bane is a powerful Sith Lord who lived one thousand years before the events of the films and is known for being the originator of the Sith's "Rule of Two", which states: "One master and one apprentice can be the only Sith in the galaxy at a time". Before it the Sith empire was structured like the Jedi but due to their shortfalls he killed them and created this new rule.
In 2014, when Lucasfilm officially rebranded the Star Wars expanded universe as Star Wars Legends, and declared it non-canon to the franchise, most of his appearances, including the comic series Jedi vs. Sith and the novels Darth Bane: Path of Destruction, Darth Bane: Rule of Two and Darth Bane: Dynasty of Evil, ceased to be canon, leaving his only canonical appearances in the sixth season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, in which his Force ghost is voiced by Mark Hamill, a mention in Star Wars (2020) #20, and a reference in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, in which Darth Sidious claims his body to contain the spirits of all Sith since Bane (a concept introduced in Dynasty of Evil), whose name is among those his acolytes chant.
