<h1>Ezra Bridger</h1><p>
</p><p>Ezra Bridger is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, voiced by Taylor Gray. He is featured as the main protagonist of the animated series Star Wars Rebels (2014–2018) and appears in related works. Ezra also appears in Forces of Destiny (2018) with Gray reprising his role. The character makes his live-action debut in the television series Ahsoka (2023), portrayed by Eman Esfandi.
In Rebels, Ezra is introduced as a 14-year old orphaned street urchin and con artist who joins the crew of the Ghost in freeing his home planet of Lothal from the tyranny of the Galactic Empire and is taken under the wing of Kanan Jarrus, who trains him in the Jedi arts, and later former Sith Maul, who trains him in how to wield the dark side of the Force. Ezra and the crew join the Rebel Alliance to assist them in their fight to free the galaxy as a whole, and face enemies such as the Inquisitors, Darth Vader, and Grand Admiral Thrawn—the latter of whom Ezra sacrifices himself to defeat, disappearing with him into another galaxy. In Ahsoka, years after the fall of the Empire, Sabine Wren travels to the other galaxy to rescue Ezra; while Ezra returns to the galaxy with Thrawn, Sabine and Ahsoka Tano are left stranded in his place.
The character has received a generally positive critical reception, with his character dynamics with Hondo Ohnaka and Thrawn receiving particular praise.
