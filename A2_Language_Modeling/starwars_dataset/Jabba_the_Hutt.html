<h1>Jabba the Hutt</h1><p>
</p><p>Jabba Desilijic Tiure, more commonly known as Jabba the Hutt, is a fictional character and major antagonist in the Star Wars franchise. Created by George Lucas, Jabba is voiced by Larry Ward with several puppeteers inside a one-ton puppet portraying him in Return of the Jedi. He was originally supposed to first appear in Star Wars (1977) as a stop motion character with Declan Mulholland as his stand-in. Jabba was later added into the film as a CGI character when it was re-released in Special Edition in 1997. He also appears in the prequel movie The Phantom Menace. The character is a large slug-like creature based on annelid worms, but he was originally designed as an apelike figure.
In the films, Jabba is a powerful crime lord on the planet Tatooine who is of the Hutt species. He is obese and often has slave girls chained to his throne. He places a bounty on smuggler Han Solo after Solo loses his cargo and sends several bounty hunters to capture him. After Darth Vader freezes Solo in carbonite, bounty hunter Boba Fett delivers him to Jabba, who puts Solo on display in his palace. Later, Princess Leia comes to save Han but is captured by Jabba, who turns her into a slave. While Luke Skywalker comes to rescue them, Leia chokes Jabba to death by wrapping the chain connected to her around his neck and pulling it tightly. Outside of the main films, Jabba first appears in the Marvel comics with the appearance of a slim humanoid with a walrus-like face.
Jabba has received generally positive reviews from critics, and his name has entered common parlance as being synonymous with negative qualities such as morbid obesity, corruption, and corporate greed.
