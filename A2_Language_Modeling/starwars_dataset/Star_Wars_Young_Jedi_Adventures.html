The Jedi younglings, Nash and RJ-83 spend time scavenging with Nash's friend Eren Kitt and her droid M1-M1 on the junk world of Bracca. While searching for scrap to salvage, M1-M1's power cell is damaged, causing the droid to lose power. The Jedi, Nash and Eren search for a power cell but a group of rodent-like PikPik scavengers get to it first. Following a chase, the two groups skirmish until Eren is able to convince the PikPik to give them one power cell needed to repair M1-M1. As a friendly gesture, Kitt agrees to a trade so that the PikPiks can obtain a circuit thruster for their damaged skiff. The PikPiks generously trade all their power cells for the circuit thruster. Kitt and her friends hope this trade would lead to more sharing and cooperation between the planet's scrappers.</p><title>"The Thieves of Tharnaka"</title><p>
