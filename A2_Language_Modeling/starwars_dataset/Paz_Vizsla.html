<h1>Paz Vizsla</h1><p>
</p><p>Paz Vizsla is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He first appeared in the first season of the Disney+ television series The Mandalorian as a member of the same tribe of Mandalorian warriors in service of the Armorer as the titular character, with whom Vizsla initially clashes with but later assists in repelling a remnant of the Galactic Empire. The two had another altercation in the spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett over ownership of the Darksaber, a legendary lightsaber forged by Paz's ancestor, Tarre Vizsla. He then returned in the third season of The Mandalorian, in which he dies protecting Bo-Katan Kryze.
Encased in physically imposing Beskar armor, Paz Vizsla is a heavy infantry warrior who uses a large, minigun-like blaster as well as a jet pack. Physically portrayed by Tait Fletcher, a stunt performer and former mixed martial artist, the character was voiced by Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner of The Mandalorian; Favreau previously voiced Pre Vizsla, another member of House Vizsla, in the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. In-universe, Vizsla is the name of one of the largest Mandalorian clans.
Paz Vizsla has received a positive response from fans and reviewers. Action figures and other merchandise of the character have been produced and sold. The character's name was initially misspelled as Paz Vizla onscreen and in marketing materials for the first season of The Mandalorian, before being corrected for the character's reappearance in The Book of Boba Fett.
