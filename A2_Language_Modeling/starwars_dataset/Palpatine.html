<h1>Palpatine</h1><p>
</p><p>Sheev Palpatine is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. He first appeared in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back as The Emperor. The character is also known by his Sith name, Darth Sidious, which was first used in the novelization of the 1999 film The Phantom Menace.
Palpatine is the main antagonist of the three film trilogies in the episodic Skywalker Saga. He is portrayed by Ian McDiarmid in all five episodes in which he physically appears. In the original trilogy, Palpatine is the emperor of the Galactic Empire and the master of Darth Vader. In the prequel trilogy, which chronicles his rise from senator to emperor, Palpatine orchestrates the invasion of his home planet Naboo in a plot to become Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. He then masterminds the Clone Wars to turn the Republic into the Empire. Palpatine also destroys the Jedi Order and manipulates the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into becoming his apprentice, Vader. In The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the final film in the sequel trilogy, a resurrected Palpatine is revealed to be the grandfather of the trilogy's main protagonist, Rey. He is also the mastermind behind Snoke, whom he created to lead the First Order against the New Republic and seduce Skywalker's grandson, Ben Solo, into becoming Kylo Ren. 
The character's story was inspired by real-world examples of democratic backsliding during the rise and rule of dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler. Since the release of the original trilogy, Palpatine has become a widely recognized symbol of evil in popular culture. Since the prequel trilogy, he has been a symbol of sinister deception and the subversion of democracy. In addition to the films, Palpatine appears in various Star Wars media, including Clone Wars (2003–2005), The Clone Wars (2008–14, 2020), Rebels (2014–2018), The Bad Batch (2021–2024), Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022) and Tales of the Jedi (2022–), all of which take place before the original trilogy.
