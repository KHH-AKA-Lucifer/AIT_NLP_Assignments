Star Wars: Tales is an American animated anthology television series created by Dave Filoni for the streaming service Disney+.

Tales of the Jedi was released on Disney+ on October 26, 2022, and received critical acclaim, with praise towards its animation, writing, and musical score.
A second installment was announced in April 2023, and was revealed a year later to be titled Tales of the Empire. Also known as Star Wars: Tales of the Empire, it is again split into two arcs: one follows Morgan Elsbeth (voiced by Diana Lee Inosanto) and the other follows former Jedi Barriss Offee (voiced by Meredith Salenger). Tales of the Empire was released on May 4, 2024.
