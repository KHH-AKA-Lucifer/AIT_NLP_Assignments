<h1>Chewbacca</h1><p>
</p><p>Chewbacca ( choo-BAH-kə), nicknamed "Chewie", is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. He is a Wookiee—a tall, hairy, highly intelligent species originating from the planet Kashyyyk. He is 7.5 feet (2.3 m) tall, and typically wears only a bandolier and a tool pouch. He carries a bowcaster, a traditional Wookiee weapon, and he speaks the Wookiee language Shyriiwook. He first appears in the original film trilogy as the loyal friend of the smuggler Han Solo. He is also the co-pilot of Han's starship, the Millennium Falcon. Chewbacca is portrayed by Peter Mayhew in five films. In The Force Awakens, Mayhew shares the role with Joonas Suotamo, who took over the portrayal for subsequent films. Chewbacca also appears in animated series, novels, comics, and video games.
