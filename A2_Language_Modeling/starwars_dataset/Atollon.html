<h1>Atollon</h1><p>Desert planet, site of Phoenix Squadron Rebel base. Home of the spider-like hexapods known as the Krykna, and the powerful force-wielder Bendu. The Battle of Atollon was allowed by Grand Admiral Thrawn himself, and destroyed most of the base, forcing the Phoenix Squadron to leave.</p>
